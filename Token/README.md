## Description

This Motoko code implements a smart contract actor named `Token` for facilitating secure and verifiable transfers of fungible tokens within an ICRC-1 compliant ledger on the Internet Computer (ICP). It allows users to initiate transfers by specifying the transfer amount and the recipient account.

## Features

* **ICRC-1 Compliance:** Ensures interoperability with other ICRC-1 compliant tokens and ledgers on the ICP ecosystem.
* **Secure Transfers:** Leverages the security mechanisms of the ICRC-1 standard to guarantee safe and reliable token transfers.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Provides a smooth user experience by processing transfers asynchronously, meaning the caller doesn't wait for the transfer to complete before continuing execution.
* **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling mechanisms to catch and report potential errors during the interaction with the ICRC-1 ledger and within the actor itself.
* **Debugging Support:** Utilizes the `Debug` canister for logging transfer details during the process, aiding in troubleshooting and monitoring activity.
